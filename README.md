**2048 AI**
  Artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting and rapidly changing fields in modern science. The use of neural networks in various spheres of life reproduces the possibilities of human thinking and opens many new perspectives in the development of software products and systems.
The object of the work is the development of a learning demonstration stand with the reinforcement of neural networks, which is based on the popular game "2048". The game "2048" is chosen as an optimal environment for research and demonstration of the capabilities of AI in solving complex tasks.

  The goal of the work is to develop the game "2048" and artificial intelligence agents that can explore this environment and play the game on par with or better than a human. This will allow not only to demonstrate the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but also to compare different methods and approaches to reinforcement learning in this context.

  The work uses a comparison and analysis of existing models and approaches in research and adaptation to new environments. 
  
  The results obtained in the form of stored trained models and their weights for later use, will allow to reproduce the experience accumulated by the agent during training on the same device in any subsequent game, without the need to train the agent again. In addition, the game "2048" itself, with all the mechanics, will be implemented for the research.
